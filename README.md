Assembly Racing Game
A lane-based racing game implemented in x86 assembly with multitasking audio and custom interrupt handlers.

Overview
This project demonstrates low-level systems programming through a DOS-based racing game. The implementation features cooperative multitasking, direct hardware control, and custom interrupt service routines—all written in pure assembly language.
Key Technical Features:

Multitasking architecture with separate task stacks
Custom timer and keyboard interrupt handlers
Direct VGA memory manipulation for graphics
PC speaker audio synthesis with background music
Real-time collision detection and game state management
